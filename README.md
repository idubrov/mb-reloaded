# MineBombers Reloaded

This project is re-implementation of the classic MineBombers 3.11. At this point, it's only a beginning with almost nothing implemented yet.

This implementation required original game installation, which you can [download] for free.

Running the game:

```
cargo run --release -- <path to installation>
```

## Why?

It's fun!
