# RIIR MineBombers

This project is re-implementation of the classic MineBombers 3.11 in Rust. It uses original resources, but runs a new, Rust binary.

Running the game:

```
cargo run --release -- <path to installation>
```

## Building

When building on macOS, make sure you have SDL2 and SDL2_Mixer installed. You can install them via Homebrew:

```
brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer
```

## Why?

As a cargo cult follower, I cannot stop myself from rewriting everything in Rust. Rewriting this game was some sort of a tribute to the very fun game I've spent many hours playing with my school friends.
